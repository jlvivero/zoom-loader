# Zoom video loader

This chrome extension is made to be able to download zoom video recordings

To use this extension:
- download and unzip this into a chosen folder
- open chrome and go to manage extensions
- click on the developer mode checkbox on the top right of the browser
- click on the load unpacked extension
- browse till you find the folder you just downloaded
- once this is set up, when you go to a zoom video a prompt will appear if you
  click yes, it will add a link at the bottom of the page that says click me
- click that link, and you can now see the video with a downloadable option

This has only been tested with one link so it may not work for all zoom links
